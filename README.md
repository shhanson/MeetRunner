# MeetRunner
MeetRunner is an application which allows Meet Directors to create and manage Weightlifting competitions. Athletes looking to compete can search and register for competitions. 

## Motivation
There doesn't currently exist a "one stop shop" for Meet Directors to collect payments from athletes, gather the required Athlete registration information, and organize their events into sessions and distribute event details. MeetRunner provides a clean interface that allows users (primarily Athletes and Meet Directors) to accomplish the tasks they want to with ease.
